Excellent. Committing to a strong, high-potential idea is the most important step. Here is a complete, phased roadmap to guide you from concept to a submission-ready Q1 conference paper for your "Neural Motion Fields for Deblurring" idea.

This roadmap is designed as a project plan. Follow it step-by-step to ensure you cover all necessary components systematically.

## **Project Roadmap: Neural Motion Fields for Physical-World Deblurring**

**Project Goal:** To develop, validate, and publish a novel theory of image deblurring based on continuous neural representations, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on complex, non-uniform motion blur.

### **Phase 0: Foundation & Environment Setup (Weeks 1-2)**

**Objective:** Prepare the workspace, codebase, and baseline models for comparison.

1.  **Literature Deep Dive:**
    *   **Must-Reads:** NeRF (Mildenhall et al.), SIREN (Sitzmann et al.), Learned Initializations for INRs (Tancik et al.), Restormer (Zamir et al.), MPRNet (Zamir et al.), DDRM (Kawar et al.).
    *   **Goal:** Understand the math, the architectural choices (SIREN), and the SOTA you need to beat.
2.  **Development Environment:**
    *   **Stack:** Python 3.8+, PyTorch 1.10+, CUDA 11+.
    *   **Hardware:** A high-VRAM GPU is essential (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090, A100). The per-image optimization will be memory and compute-intensive.
    *   **Setup:** Create a dedicated Conda/virtual environment. Install PyTorch, Torchvision, `skimage`, `opencv-python`, `lpips`.
3.  **Acquire Baseline Code:**
    *   Clone the official GitHub repositories for your key baselines:
        *   **SOTA Transformer:** **Restormer** (most likely).
        *   **SOTA Generative:** **DDRM** or another strong conditional diffusion model.
    *   **Action:** Run their inference code on a sample blurry image from the GoPro dataset to ensure you can reproduce their results. This is crucial for later comparison.

### **Phase 1: Core Model Implementation (MVP) (Weeks 3-5)**

**Objective:** Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that proves the core concept can work on a simple case.

1.  **Neural Field Architecture:**
    *   Implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch.
    *   **Key Innovation:** Implement or import a **SIREN (Sinusoidal Representation Network)** layer. The sinusoidal activation `sin(ωx)` is critical for representing the high-frequency details in images.
    *   **Model Signature:** `NMF_Model(coords, t) -> (RGB, a)` where `coords` are `(x, y)` and `t` is time. Let's ignore motion (`Δx, Δy`) for the MVP and focus on reconstructing a "video" of a static scene first. The alpha `a` can be used for compositing.
2.  **Differentiable Blur Renderer:**
    *   Write a PyTorch function that takes your `NMF_Model` and renders a blurry image.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Input: Model `f_θ`, image resolution `(H, W)`, number of time samples `N`.
        *   Generate a grid of pixel coordinates.
        *   For each pixel, sample `N` random time points `t_i` from `[0, 1]`.
        *   Query the `NMF_Model` for each `(x, y, t_i)` to get `N` color values.
        *   **Monte Carlo Integration:** Average the `N` color values to get the final rendered pixel color `B_hat(x,y)`.
3.  **Per-Image Optimization Loop:**
    *   Write a script that:
        *   Loads a *single* blurry image `B`.
        *   Initializes your `NMF_Model` with random weights.
        *   **Loop for N_iters (e.g., 2000 steps):**
            *   Render the predicted blurry image `B_hat` using the current model `f_θ`.
            *   Calculate a simple reconstruction loss: `L_recon = MSE(B_hat, B)`.
            *   Backpropagate the loss through the renderer and the model.
            *   Update the model weights `θ` with an optimizer (e.g., Adam).
            *   Periodically save the rendered *sharp* image (by evaluating the model at `t=0.5`) to visualize progress.
4.  **Sanity Check:** Test on a synthetically blurred image (e.g., a simple box blur on a photo of a cat). The goal is to see the model converge to a reasonable, less blurry output. It will be imperfect, but it proves the pipeline works.

### **Phase 2: The "Hero" Contribution - CMT Dataset Creation (Weeks 3-6, Parallel to Phase 1)**

**Objective:** Build the **Complex Motion Trajectories (CMT)** benchmark that will make your paper stand out.

1.  **Source Video Acquisition:** Download 20-30 high-quality, high-FPS (60/120fps) video clips from Pexels, etc. Focus on static scenes with distinct foreground objects.
2.  **Motion Path Scripting:** Write a Python script to generate a library of 2D parametric motion paths `p(t) = (x(t), y(t))`.
    *   **Types:** Linear, Circular, Figure-8, Sinusoidal, Spiral, Sharp Turns (piecewise).
    *   **Output:** Save these paths as `.npy` files.
3.  **Synthesis Pipeline:** Create a script `synthesize_cmt.py`.
    *   **Function:** `create_blur(sharp_frame, motion_path, num_frames_to_average)`
    *   **Logic:**
        *   For each of the `num_frames_to_average`, calculate the displacement from the `motion_path`.
        *   Use `scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates` or a similar advanced warping function to apply the displacement to the `sharp_frame`.
        *   Average all warped frames.
    *   **Output:** For each example, save three files: `001_blur.png`, `001_sharp_gt.png`, `001_motion_gt.npy`.
    *   **Goal:** Generate a test set of ~100 challenging examples.

### **Phase 3: Model Refinement & Full Implementation (Weeks 6-8)**

**Objective:** Evolve the MVP into the final, powerful model by incorporating full motion modeling and regularization.

1.  **Integrate Non-Uniform Motion:**
    *   Modify the NMF model signature: `NMF_Model(x, y, t) -> (RGB, Δx, Δy)`. The model now predicts a per-pixel displacement field that changes over time.
    *   Update the renderer: When querying the model at `(x, y, t_i)`, use the predicted displacement to sample the color from a warped position: `RGB = ColorDecoder(f_θ(x + Δx(t_i), y + Δy(t_i)))`.
2.  **Implement Regularization Priors (The Secret Sauce):**
    *   **Motion Smoothness Loss (`L_motion`):** Add a term to the loss that penalizes jerky motion. Calculate the second-order finite difference of the displacement field `(Δx, Δy)` with respect to time and minimize its L2 norm.
    *   **Appearance Regularization (`L_tv`):** Add a Total Variation (TV) loss on the rendered sharp frame (`t=0.5`) to encourage sharp edges and reduce noise.
    *   **Perceptual Loss (`L_lpips`):** Replace/augment the MSE reconstruction loss with LPIPS for more perceptually pleasing results.
3.  **Final Loss Function:**
    *   `L_total = λ_recon * L_lpips(B_hat, B) + λ_motion * L_motion + λ_tv * L_tv`
    *   **Action:** Experiment to find good `λ` weights. This is a critical tuning step.

### **Phase 4: Rigorous Experimentation & Ablation (Weeks 9-12)**

**Objective:** Generate all the quantitative and qualitative results needed for the paper.

1.  **Quantitative Evaluation:**
    *   **Scripting:** Write a master evaluation script that can run a method (yours or a baseline) on an entire dataset and compute average PSNR/SSIM.
    *   **Run on Standard Datasets:** GoPro, RealBlur. Tabulate results against Restormer and DDRM.
    *   **Run on CMT Benchmark:** Run your method and baselines on your new dataset.
        *   **Table 1:** PSNR/SSIM. (Expect a big win for your method).
        *   **Table 2:** Motion Path Error (MSE between your recovered motion and the ground truth `_motion_gt.npy`). This is a unique contribution.
2.  **Qualitative Evaluation:**
    *   **CMT Showcase:** Generate comparison figures for your best CMT results. Show: `Input | Restormer | DDRM | Ours (Sharp) | Ours (Recovered Path)`.
    *   **In-the-Wild Showcase:** Use your hand-picked challenging real-world images. Create stunning comparison figures. These are for the introduction and main results section.
3.  **Ablation Studies:** This is non-negotiable for a Q1 paper.
    *   **Priors:** Run your model on a subset of CMT with different loss combinations:
        *   `L_recon` only
        *   `L_recon + L_tv`
        *   `L_recon + L_motion`
        *   Full Model (`L_recon + L_tv + L_motion`)
    *   **Architecture:** Compare your SIREN-based NMF to one using standard ReLUs to show why SIREN is superior.
    *   **Renderer:** Analyze the effect of the number of time samples `N` (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64) on final quality vs. runtime.

### **Phase 5: Paper Writing & Submission (Weeks 10-14, Parallel to Phase 4)**

**Objective:** Craft a compelling narrative and submit the paper.

1.  **Drafting (Start Early):**
    *   **Week 10:** Write the Introduction, Related Work, and Method sections. Create diagrams for your NMF architecture and the differentiable rendering process.
    *   **Week 11-12:** As experiments finish, create all tables and figures. Write the Experiments section, carefully describing the setup and analyzing the results.
    *   **Week 13:** Write the Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work. Polish the Abstract. Get feedback from colleagues.
2.  **Final Polish:** Proofread, check for clarity, ensure all claims are supported by evidence (your results).
3.  **Submission:**
    *   **Pre-print:** Submit to arXiv ~1-2 weeks before the conference deadline to establish precedence.
    *   **Conference:** Format according to the conference template (CVPR, ICCV, etc.) and submit.

This comprehensive roadmap covers every aspect of the project, from the initial idea to the final paper. By following these phases, you will build a robust project with a strong theoretical contribution, a novel dataset, and the rigorous experimental validation required for a top-tier publication.
